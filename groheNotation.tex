$v \unlhd^T w \qE  v$ is an ancestor of $w$.  The root is the min wrt $\unlhd$.

${\cal T}_k$ the set of all graphs of tree width at most $k$.

${\cal T(C)}$ is the class of graphs having a tree decomposition whose torso is in ${\cal C}$.

${\cal G}_k$ is the class of graphs on at most $k$ vertices.  Thus ${\cal T}_k = {\cal T}({\cal
  G}_{k+1})$.
